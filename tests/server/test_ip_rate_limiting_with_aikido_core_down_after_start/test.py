1. Bring the mock server down (similate aikido core going down after the started event so we can pull the rate limiting config).
2. Sets up the rate limiting config to 5 requests / minute for route '/'.
3. Sends 5 requests to '/'. Checks that those requests are not blocked.
4. Send another more 5 request to '/'. Checks that they all are rate limited.
5. Sends 100 requests to another route '/tests'. Checks that those requests are not blocked.
